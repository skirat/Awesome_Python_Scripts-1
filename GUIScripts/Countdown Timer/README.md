# Coundown Timer

## Aim:

-To create a countdown timer which counts the days and time left for the Event.

## Purpose:

- To know the time left for the event to occur by inputing the event date and time.

## Description:

- This project is to build a Countdown Timer using tkinter.
- For creation of Countdown Timer Using Python, we will need to import Python modules one for creating GUI,for using font for displaying time and another to get datetime data.
- For GUI we will use **"tkinter module"**.

## Procedure: 

```python
from tkinter import *
from tkinter import ttk
from tkinter import font
import time
import datetime
```
- After importing modules, we will create a window.
- Now we create functions quit which is used for exiting out of the application.
- Secondly we will create a function called countdown_for_event which finds the time and date left for the event.
- We get the user inputs for date and time of the event and display the left out days and time using GUI.
- The format for displaying the colors and fonts can also be changed according to our wish.

## Compilation Steps:

- Install python.
- Import the neccessary modules and run the program.
