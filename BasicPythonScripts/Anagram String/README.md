# Anagram String

## Aim

It is a program where we play with Anagram String.

## Purpose

To check whether two strings entered by user are anagram strings or not.

## Short description

- An anagram of a string is a another string that contains same chatacters but only the order of characters can be different.
- For Example, "race" and "care" are angram of each other.
- User enter two random strings and program will tell that the entered two stirngs are anagram string or not.


## Workflow of the Project

1. Firstly, the program demands a two strings from the user.
2. checking length of both strings are same or not. if not same print strings are not anagram string otherwise continue.
3. converted strings into lower case and sorted the strings.
4. checking both sorting stirgs is same or not.
    a) If it is same then print both strigns are anagram string.
    b) otherwise print both strings are not anagram string.


## Compilation Steps

1. Download the python in your local system.
2. Run this program in a proper IDE e.g. Visual Studio Code, Pycharm, Jupyter Notebook etc. or any online Compiler like Repelit.
3. Enter two strings if you want to check strings are anagram string or not.
4. You can show both strings are anagram string or not.
