## Description:
- My project works on Crack Any Password.
- To create a python script which is crack any password, we will need to import a **random** module.
- It work on the concept of **brute force**,
- So, the process is something like that we will ask the user to enter some characters i.e. password, and then we will try to guess the password using brute force attack.
- **AIM**: It mainly focus on the password entered by the user and guess the password using brute force.

## Procedure: 
```python
from random import *
```
- First after importing modules.
- After that we will take input from the user.
- Then we will store alphabet letter to use them to crack password.
- After that we will initialize an empty string **guess**. 
- Then we will use while loop to generate many passwords untill one of them does not matches.
