# Earthquakes.py 

The Earthquakes.py program displays information about earthquakes registered in Oregon and Pennsylvania in the past seven days. (I chose these two states because thatâ€™s where our family lives.) You could easily change the code to display earthquakes in other states. The information comes from an API provided by the [U.S. Geological Survey] (https://www.usgs.gov/products/data-and-tools/apis).

# Output
