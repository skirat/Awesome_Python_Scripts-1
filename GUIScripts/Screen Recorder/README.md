# Screen Recorder
## Aim 
To build a screen recorder using Python pyautogui.
## Purpose
Screen Recorder is a software used to record your screen and saves it as a video file.
## Short description
- This code enables us to record screen easily.
- Recorded file will be saved as "Recording.avi"
- Libraries imported :
    - `pyautogui`
    -  `CV2`
    -   `numpy`

## Workflow
- Imported required libraries i.e.,`pyautogui`,`CV2`,`numpy`.
- Resolution is set to 1920x1080.
- Framerate is set to 60.0 mps.
- Created a video object and an empty window, resized this window and named it as LIVE.
- PyautoGUI is used to take screenshots.
- numpy will convert those screenshots into an array.
## Compilation Steps
- Download the file [screen_recorder.py](https://github.com/tanujadasari/Awesome_Python_Scripts/blob/main/GUIScripts/Screen%20Recorder/screen_recorder.py)
- Run the file [screen_recorder.py](https://github.com/tanujadasari/Awesome_Python_Scripts/blob/main/GUIScripts/Screen%20Recorder/screen_recorder.py), let's start recording our screen.
- Install pyautogui, CV2, numpy if you don't have them.
- After clicking run,it takes continuous screenshots and makes it into an array, out.write will convert this as a video.
- The screen will continue to record until we press `q`
- Finally, recorded file will be saved as "Recording.avi".
