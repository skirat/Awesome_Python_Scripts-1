# FIBONACCI SEQUENCE GENERATOR
  It's a program where we play with mathematical integers and operation to genarate a unique series.
  
## **_Title_**
To generate a seires called "Fibonacci Series"

## **_What it is ?_** 
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

### _Explanation with the help of example :-_
Predefined,  

1st no.(F0) =0     

2nd no.(F1) = 1

So the third number will be F2 = F0 + F1 

Similarly the fourth number will be F3 = F1 + F2 ..........and so on 

## **_Overview / Description_**
 User will enter how many number they want in a series and whole series will be printed.
 
## **_Workflow Steps_**
1.)Firstly, the program will demand the number of terms u want to see in the series.

2.)Starting two digits are predefined a1=0 and a2=1.

3.)Now it will pass through the conditional statements :-
                    
                    a.) case1 : If the entered digit is less than or equal to zero
                    
                    b.) case2 : if the no. of digit is 1.
                    
                    c.) case3 : Finally user input a valid no. of digit . Now the algorithm will follow.

4.) Entering in the while loop and following the commands for appropriate output.


## **_Compilation Steps:_**
1.) Run this program in a proper IDE e.g. Pycharm, VScode ,Jupyter notebook etc or any Online compiler like Repelit.

2.) Enter the number of terms.

3.) The output will show you the series.
