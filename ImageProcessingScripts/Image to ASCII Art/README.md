## Description: 
- Let's [**see**](https://github.com/Iamtripathisatyam/Awesome_Python_Scripts/blob/main/ImageProcessingScripts/Image%20to%20ASCII%20Art/image_to_ascii.py) a Python script that will convert any Image to ASCII art.
- For the conversion, I'll be utilising the **pywhatkit** module.
- **image to ascii art** is a function in the **pywhatkit** that assists with the conversion.

## Procedure to follow: 
```python
import pywhatkit
```
- Now, call the **user image** function with the path of the input image.
- Also, provide the location in which you wish the result to be saved as a text file.
- Now, provide both the path and the result to the function **image to ascii art** to view the outcome.
