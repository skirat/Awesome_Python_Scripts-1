# Squirrel Game

## Aim

The aim of this project is to create a game using pygame module.


## Short description of package/script

- If standalone script, short description of script explaining what it achieves.
  The player controls a small squirrel that must hop around the screen eating smaller squirrels and avoiding larger squirrels. Each time the player’s squirrel eats a squirrel that is smaller than it, it grows larger. If the player’s squirrel gets hit by a larger squirrel larger than it, it loses a life point.

- List out the libraries imported.
  - random
  - pygame
  - sys
  - time
  - math

## Setup instructions

Download the squirrel python code file.

Install the pygame module - `pip install pygame`

Double click the code and enjoy the game.
