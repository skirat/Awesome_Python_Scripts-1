## Description:
- My project works on displaying a GUI Calendar
- To create GUI Calendar Using Python, we will need to import two Python modules one for creating GUI and another to get year data.
- For GUI we will use **"tkinter module"** because itâ€™s very easy to learn and use.
- And to get any year data we will use **"calendar module"**.

## Procedure: 
```python
from tkinter import *
import calendar
```
- First after importing modules, we will then initialise tkinter
- After that we will set title for our GUI.
- Then we will take input from user for which year you want to display the calendar.
- After that using label widget it will show calendar.
- Then it will pack the label widget and it will show output in ready state.
