# Connect Four

## Aim

The main aim of the project is to create a 'Connect Four' game using the python's PyGame library.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to give the user a gaming experience of playing the original Connect Four game. 

## Short description of package/script

This is a very basic version of the famous game 'Connect Four' which is a two player 2D game. To play this game we need two players, one players plays with the red dots and the other player plays with the yellow dots. Each player takes turn to drop the dots in the 6x7 grid. The one who connects the four colored dots in either horizontal, vertical or diagonal line together first wins the game. 

The project is developed using python3 and python's PyGame library.

## Workflow of the Project

- We have installed and used the 'numpy' module to develop the logic of the game.
- We have installed and used the 'pygame' module to give graphics to our game.
- Just run the script through the terminal.


## Setup instructions
