# Fidget Spinner(Game)

## Short description of package/script
### Logic:
The logic of the game is that the turns will keep increasing as you press the space bar, and it will reduce its speed and stop at a point where you stop pressing the space bar.
 Here we will use distutils for functioning and turtle for the animation.
## List out the libraries imported:
distuntils, turtle

## Setup instructions

Here for setup we not need to do anything just running the script and then we need to press space button to spin the fidget as fast we press the speed increases.
