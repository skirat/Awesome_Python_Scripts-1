A calculator App
## Short description of package/script
- it is a basic python script calculator app.
- imported `tkinter` in python.

## Setup instructions
Firstly, download the python script in your local computer and run it, it will work successfully.

## Detailed explanation of script, if needed
As you can see, nowadays calculating big-big numbers is very tough or it may takes time to solve. I have created a basic python script `Calculator app` where you can calculate the numbers.
In my Script, I have imported tkinter which is really very easy in python.
I have created function for adding values, clear when we don't won't to calculate some number and also for expression one, i.e `"hello"`. Adding a silver line to it, I have created 9 buttons for numbers from 0-9 and also for `+`, `-`, `/` and `*`.
