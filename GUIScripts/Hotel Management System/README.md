# Hotel Management System

## Aim

The main aim of the project is to create a mangement application where it collect the information of the user to check in and checkout.

## Purpose

The purpose is that to create a easy application for the hotel manager to maintain the record easily and able to create the bill receipt.

## Short description of package/script


- If standalone script, short description of script explaining what it achieves.
   
   I have created a pyhton script where it uses tkinter application to bring output as a GUI Application. It has features as check in, check out, list of Guest, Information about guest and exit button for user-friendly application. 
   
- List out the libraries imported.

   - Tkinter
   - Pickle
   - sys
   - Os

## Workflow of the Project

- When the main program runs it excutes the first page of the application where it shows the list of button 
- When the check in button is pressed it redirects to the another python code file and runs that file.
   -  It is a page to collect the information of the guests like name, address, mobil number etc.
   -  It also ask to choose the room model and for how many days
   -  Then it ask for payment option either cash or debit/credit card.
   -  Then it generates the Receipt Form.
- When the List of Guest button is pressed it redirects to the another python code file and runs that file.
   -  It shows the list of customer in which room.
   -  If they are checked-out their names will not be there.
- When the check out button is pressed it redirects to the another python code file and runs that file.
   -  It will ask the user to enter the room number.
   -  When room number is valid it will be checked out.
- When the Info button is pressed it redirects to the another python code file and runs that file.
   -  It will ask the room number.
   -  When room number is pressed it will give the information about the guests.
- When the Exit button is pressed it will kill the code and comes out of the application.
