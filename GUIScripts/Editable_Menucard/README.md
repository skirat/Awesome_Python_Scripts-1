# Editable Restaurant Menucard
- This project aims to make a Editable Menucard for a Restaurant. It will help the Admin to freely edit (Add, Remove, Change Description, Change Price) the items of a menucard for each day seperately.

- Admin enters ID of orders to accept and update the preparation status of the same.

## Short description of package/script
- Libraries used : tkinter, Pillow (PIL)
- tkinter provides users with a simple way to create GUI elements.
- PIL is used to add support for opening, manipulating, and saving images. 

## Setup instructions
Install Python 3.x (recommended) from https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Install tkinter and PIL
- Download this repository as zip and extract.
- Use Python IDLE and run the code.
- You can run it on any python IDE. Preferably use IDLE.

## Purpose of this project
This project demonstrates concepts of:
- Object Oriented Programming: Through this poject's code one could understand how to define classes, concept of inheritance and thus defining superclasses. 
- GUI designing using tkinter: It also demonstrates the use of tkinter to create any GUI. One could understand way of connecting functionality to the visual element by referring to this repository.
- Login/Registration and defining Input field constraints
- Project in itself aims at real world problem and thus, could help in building up of ability to come up with an approch, think of possibility of errors and establishing proper plan/flow to complete it.

## Future Scope
- Attaching database.
- Improving the input field constraints

## Workflow:
- Necessary comments are mentioned in the code. Short Description of functions is also added.
- As you run the code, Main Menu is displayed. This displays the menu for each day of the week. It has a login button
- User can login. Two types of users are defined- Admin and Customer. Their Functionality differs likewise.
- Customer Functions: Check out the items available, order items, check the status of their order
- Admin Functions: Check out the current menu , Make changes to the menu, Receive/Accept orders from customers, Deliver and Update status of the order, Updating the list.
- Registeration option for new users is also possible.
