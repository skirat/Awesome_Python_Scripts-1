# Package/Script Name
Preview your link
## Short description of package/script

-  I have imported requests, json, os, time
and from bs4 imported BeautifulSoup.

## Setup instructions
Once you download the requiremets that I have mentioned above, you download the code and run it, give your link then  the computer will provide with title,
description, and link of the website that the URL points to.

## Detailed explanation of script, if needed

Once, we do above steps, we will start writing the code. So, what I first wrote is that to find the url link. after that, I wanted to get the description of the 
URL, so I wrote a function name called `getDesc` where in it will give me twitter description, name description and all. and then, i took another function
nam called `getImage` this is super exciting part as it will provide the image of the given URL Description, if it exists.  and then, last function called `getdata` 
it will give me data. 
### after completing above steps, now lets focus on, 
that whether the given URL exsists or not, if it does, then we will ask for database. since the information we want will store in db.
if the above is false and if not in db get via request. that's it, you are done.
