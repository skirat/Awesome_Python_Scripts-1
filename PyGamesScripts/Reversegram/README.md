# Reversegram - Game

## Aim

 The main aim is to create a Reversegam game that has an 8×8 board and tiles that are black on one side and white on the other (our game will use Os and Xs instead).

## Purpose

 The purpose of this project is creating a game using python for the players who can spend the time in leisure hours.
