# Oddly Satisfying Animation/Game
This project is an animation of oddly satisfying type of games where animation goes on in an infinite loop and player could provide input to the slab by pressing spacebar, creating some disturbance in the smooth motion of other elements. Various Elements keep moving around the screen bouncing off the surfaces. User input affects one of them.


## Short description of package/script
PyGame is used to create this project. PyGame module is used to create 2D games in python.

## Setup instructions
- Install Python 3.x (recommended) from https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Install PyGame
- Download this repository as zip and extract.
- Use Python IDLE and run the code.
- You can run it on any python IDE. Preferably use IDLE.

## Purpose of adding this project
- This project demonstrates concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Through this poject's code one could understand how to define classes, concept of inheritance and thus defining superclasses. It also demonstrates the use of PyGame to create any game. One could understand the flow of a 2D designing and coding by referring to this repository. 

## Workflow:
- Necessary comments are mentioned in the code.
- As you run the code, Main Menu is displayed.
- Instruction to control slab is displayed here. 
- To proceed click anywhere on the screen. This catches the MOUSEBUTTONDOWN event and 'main()' is called.
- There are two types of elements- Bouncers and Slab. Bouncer keep on moving and Slab is gravity affected element and could be made to jump by pressing spacebaar.
- This goes on in infinite loop till 'QUIT' event is caught.
