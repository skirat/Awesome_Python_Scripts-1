    - `psutil`
    - `time`
    - `pyttsx3`
    - `win10toast`
    - `ToastNotifier`
    - `threading`
## Workflow
- Import all the required libraries i.e., psutil, time, pyttsx3, win10toast, Toast Notifier, threading.
- `psutil`
    - ***Installation:***  `pip install psutil`
    - ***Purpose:*** Used for system monitoring
- `time`
    - ***Installation:***  This Library is part of Python's Standard library no need install separately.
    - ***Purpose:*** Delaying notification
- `pyttsx3`
    - ***Installation:***  `pip install pyttsx3`
    - ***Purpose:*** This is text to speech convertor used here to generate voice notification.
- `win10toast`
    - ***Installation:***  `pip install win10toast`
    - ***Purpose:***  Used for importind `Toast Notifier`. This displays notification.
- `threading`
    - ***Installation:***  `pip install threading`
    - ***Purpose:*** Used to give desktop notification and voice notification at the same time.

## Compilation Steps
- Download the file [Dr_Battery.py](https://github.com/DurgaSai-16/Awesome_Python_Scripts/blob/main/GUIScripts/Dr%20Battery/Dr_Battery.py)
- Run the file [Dr_Battery.py](https://github.com/DurgaSai-16/Awesome_Python_Scripts/blob/main/GUIScripts/Dr%20Battery/Dr_Battery.py)
- Now our Dr Battery starts Monitoring our Lappy. Leave it in the background do your works in Lappy.
- When Lappy goes below 40% then it generates a voice asking you to plug in the charge as well as a notification saying the same. This won't stop until you plug the charger.
- When Lappy goes above 90% then it generates a voice asking you to unplug the charge as well as a notification saying the same. This won't stop until you unplug the charger.
- If you forgot to unplug and it reaches 100% then it generates notification saying battery full please unplug. This won't stop until you plug out the charger from the socket.
