# Loan Calculator

## Aim

To make a Loan calculator

## Purpose

For calculating the monthly repay and annual repay of loan amount in an easier manner.

## Short description of package/script
 - Here using the tkinter we had made an gui script where we ask the user their rate of interest and the amount of loan and duration and from that we give their repay amount, so it will be easier for a bank employeer and customer both to get a loan at the cheapest rate.
- List out the libraries imported- >tkinter


## Workflow of the Project

After running the script the gui application will pop and asks the user about rate of interest and the amount of loan and duration and will give repay amount as output.


## Setup instructions

Firstly install tkinter library and then run the script so the gui application will pop and asks the user about rate of interest and the amount of loan and duration and will give repay amount as output.
