# The 2D Shape Area Calculator ðŸ§®
## Aim 
To Calculate the Area of 2D shapes
## Purpose
The 2D shape Area Calculator is basic python script enables us to easily calculate Areas of 2D shapes.
## Short description
- This code is used find area of respective 2D shape by giving specified inputs. (Eg: If our 2D Shape is circle.To find Area of cirlce required input will be it's radius)
- **Libraries Imported:**  `math`

## Workflow
- Choose one option from the following 2D shape for which you need to find area
  - `Circle`
  - `Triangle`
  - `Square`
  - `Rectangle`
  - `Parallelogram`
  - `Trapezium`
  - `Ellipse`
- Enter required inputs properly as follows:
  - If `circle` is opted then, required input is `radius`
  - If `Triangle` is opted then, required inputs are `base` `height` or `sides`
  - If `Square` is opted then, required input is `side` 
  - If `Rectangle` is opted then, required inputs are `length` and `breadth`
  - If `Parallelogram` is opted then, required inputs are `length` and `breadth`
  - If `Trapezium` is opted then, required are `bases` and `height`
  - If `Ellipse` is opted then, required inputs are `axis`
- Based on the shape opted by the user, it executes that particular block of code and takes input from user and gives Area as output.

## Compilation Steps
- Download " [2D_shapes_area_calculator.py](https://github.com/DurgaSai-16/Awesome_Python_Scripts/blob/main/BasicPythonScripts/The%202D%20Shape%20Area%20Calculator/2D_shapes_area_calculator.py) " file.
- Run "2D_shapes_area_calculator.py" file.
- Find the area of any 2D shape by entering required inputs properly.
- This program is made of simple "if - elif - else" syntax.
- Start of the program every 2D shape is assigned a particular option. i.e., `print("Please choose one of the following option to find Areas of 2D shape: \n1.Circle \n2.Triangle \n3.Square \n4.Rectangle \n5.Parallelogram \n6.Trapezium \n7.Ellipse")`
- The `if` statement checks for condition and if this condition evaluates to True,then the statements inside the if block will be executed. 
- If `if` condition evaluates to False, then flow of program control goes to `elif` statement and if this condition evaluates to True,then the statements inside the elif block will be executed.
- The flow of control goes to `else`condition when the `elif` condition evaluates to False. 
- For more information on import statements, refer to "[requirements.txt](https://github.com/DurgaSai-16/Awesome_Python_Scripts/blob/main/BasicPythonScripts/The%202D%20Shape%20Area%20Calculator/requirements.txt)".
