<p>This application can be used anywhere (grocery shop) by taking the user Items  Input.I have implemented it using python tkinter library.As you can see there are many items and four buttons. Buttons are Total,Generate Bill,Clear,Bill.At first you have to put your name, bill no, phone number. Then you've to put the items you need(whatever you want) and click on generate bill.You will see the entire bill on the right section.If you want to exit then press exit, if you want to clear the bill then click press Clear button.</p>
