    "On the night of October 11, Christopher Columbus and the crew of Santa Maria reported a sighting of unknown light, just days before the landing at Guanahani.",
	"USS Pickering, on course from Guadeloupe to Delaware, lost with 90 people on board. (Possibly lost in a gale)",

	"According to legend a sailing ship the Ellen Austin found a derelict vessel and placed a crew to sail the vessel to port. Two versions of what happened to the vessel are: the vessel was either lost in a storm or was found again without a crew. Lawrence David Kusche author of 'The Bermuda Triangle Mystery-Solved' found no mention in 1880 or 1881 newspapers of this alleged incident-he did trace the legend to a book by Rupert Gould 'The Stargazer Talks' published in 1943. The 'Ellen Austin' did exist, a check from Lloyd's of London records proved the existence of Meta, built in 1854, and that in 1880, Meta was renamed Ellen Austin. There are no casualty listings for this vessel, or any vessel at that time, that would suggest a large number of missing men were placed on board a derelict that later disappeared although one website includes the alleged derelict vessel incident it does find that Rupert Gould talked about the legend on radio in the 1930s; likewise the website traces the derelict story to a June 1906 newspaper story-which claims the derelict ship incident took place in 1891; however the 1906 story does not give a reference of where this story came from.",

	"USS Proteus (AC-9), lost with all 58 persons on board in heavy seas, having departed St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands with a cargo of bauxite on 23 November. The following month, her sister ship USS Nereus (AC-10) was lost with all 61 persons on board, having also departed St. Thomas with a cargo of bauxite, on 10 December. According to research by Rear Admiral George van Deurs, USN, who was familiar with this type of ship from their service in the USN, the acidic coal cargo would seriously erode the longitudinal support beams, making these aging and poorly constructed colliers extremely vulnerable to breaking up in heavy seas.[27] They were both sister ships of the USS Cyclops.",

The ship was taken one mile off the Miami coastline so that Burack and Horgan could view the Christmas lights visible from the shore.That night, Burack radioed a distress call to the Coast Guard, informing them that the boat's propeller had struck something underwater, and that the vessel would need to be towed in. The Coast Guard requested that he send up a flare in roughly 20 minutes so that the boat could be more easily located.The official who received the call reportedly later noted that Burack did not seem too concerned about the Witchcraft,a boat that Burack had fitted with a special floatation device in its hull. When the Coast Guard arrived at the location from which Burack called, he, Horgan, and the Witchcraft were nowhere to be found.Over the following days, a search was conducted over hundreds of square miles of ocean, but the boat and its passengers were not able to be located.",
