# Description:
- This project displays the time in digital clock format
- For creation of digital clock Using Python, we will need to import Python modules one for creating GUI, font for displaying time and another to get datetime data.
- For GUI we will use **"tkinter module"**.
- And to get time and date data we will use **"datetime and time"**.

## Procedure: 
```python
from tkinter import *
from tkinter import ttk
from tkinter import font
import time
import datetime
```
- After importing modules, we will then initialise tkinter
- Then we will add two functions one for quit another one for running the clock.
- We can change the background color,font and font size according to our wish.
- Then run the project the output will show the digital clock in H:M:S format.
- The format for displaying the time can also be changed according to our wish.
