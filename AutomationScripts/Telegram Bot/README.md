# Telegram Bot

## Aim

To make a  telegram bot of our own
## Purpose

To assign the functions to our bot

## Short description of package/script

- Here we make a telegram bot using the telegram library then assigning the bot some functions on which it will reply some thing.
- For example if we type "Hello" then it will type "Hello , I am fine what about you?"
- List out the libraries imported ->telegram


## Workflow of the Project

First go to botFather in telegram then type new bot so it will ask name and description for new bot and then it will give api key so keep that key in the script and then make your own functions.

## Setup instructions
Get an api key from telegram BotFather then write it in the script and then make changes in the function as per requirement and then run the script and then write it in the telegram so output will be shown.
